# Static Site Exercise

Hey! This is my static website for Assignment 1.6. I built it using Next.js and deployed it to GitHub Pages.

## What I Did

I created a simple static site that shows:

- How to set up a basic Next.js project
- How to create a simple page with HTML and React
- How to export it as static files
- How to deploy it to GitHub Pages

## Running It Locally

If you want to see it on your computer:

1. Install the dependencies first:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy, you need to build it:

```
npm run build
```

This creates an `out` folder with all the static HTML files that GitHub Pages can serve.

## Deployment

I deployed this to GitHub Pages. The `out` folder contains all the static files that get served when someone visits the site.
