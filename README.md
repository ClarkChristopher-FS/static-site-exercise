# Static Site Exercise

This is my static website for Assignment 1.6. Built with Next.js and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## What I Did

I created a simple static site that demonstrates:

- Setting up a basic Next.js project
- Creating a simple page with HTML and React
- Exporting it as static files
- Deploying to GitHub Pages

## Running It Locally

To run it on your computer:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Building for Production

To build for deployment:

```
npm run build
```

This creates an `out` folder with all the static HTML files. I moved those files to the root so GitHub Pages can serve them.

## Deployment

Deployed to GitHub Pages using the root folder. The static files are in the root directory so GitHub Pages can find them.
